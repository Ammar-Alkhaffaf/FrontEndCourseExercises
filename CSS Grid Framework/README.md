# HTML & CSS | ADVANCED CSS | PROJECT: DESIGN YOUR OWN GRID-BASED FRAMEWORK

[**Submission Instructions (Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab)**](https://github.com/SocialHackersAcademy/FrontEndCourseExercises/#instructions)

#### INSTRUCTIONS

You'll be creating your own grid-based framework.

1. Create a new CSS document.

2. Think about the major elements that are required of a framework.  This includes a CSS reset, a fixed number of grids separated by "gutters", a way to make new rows, and default values for the font properties of elements.

3. Write the CSS necessary to create a basic 12-column grid framework.  Check out the [960 Grid System documentation](http://960.gs) for a look at how they do it.  The complexity is up to you -- there's no need to go too crazy with details (you're not trying to rebuild Bootstrap).
