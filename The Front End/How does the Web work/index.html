          <h2>What is the Internet Protocol (IP)?</h2>
          <p>
            The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for
            routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel
            across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data
            traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called
            packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this
            information helps routers to send packets to the right place. Every
            device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP
            address, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to
            them, data arrives where it is needed. Once the packets arrive at
            their destination, they are handled differently depending on which
            transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common
            transport protocols are TCP and UDP.

            What is a network protocol?
          </h3>
          <p>
            In networking, a protocol is a standardized way of doing certain
            actions and formatting data so that two or more devices are able to
            communicate with and understand each other. To understand why
            protocols are necessary, consider the process of mailing a letter.
            On the envelope, addresses are written in the following order: name,
            street address, city, state, and zip code. If an envelope is dropped
            into a mailbox with the zip code written first, followed by the
            street address, followed by the state, and so on, the post office
            won't deliver it. There is an agreed-upon protocol for writing
            addresses in order for the postal system to work. In the same way,
            all IP data packets must present certain information in a certain
            order, and all IP addresses follow a standardized format.

          <h2>What is an IP address? How does IP addressing work?</h2>
          <p>
            An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device or domain
            that connects to the Internet. Each IP address is a series of
            characters, such as '192.168.1.1'. Via DNS resolvers, which
            translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, users are
            able to access websites without memorizing this complex series of
            characters. Each IP packet will contain both the IP address of the
            device or domain sending the packet and the IP address of the
            intended recipient, much like how both the destination address and
            the return address are included on a piece of mail.

          <h2>How does IP routing work?</h2>
          <p>
            The Internet is made up of interconnected large networks that are
            each responsible for certain blocks of IP addresses; these large
            networks are known as autonomous systems (AS). A variety of routing
            protocols, including BGP, help route packets across ASes based on
            their destination IP addresses. Routers have routing tables that
            indicate which ASes the packets should travel through in order to
            reach the desired destination as quickly as possible. Packets travel
            from AS to AS until they reach one that claims responsibility for
            the targeted IP address. That AS then internally routes the packets
            to the destination. Protocols attach packet headers at different
            layers of the OSI model:
          </p>

          />
          <p style="padding-top: 0px">
            Packets can take different routes to the same place if necessary,
            just as a group of people driving to an agreed-upon destination can
            take different roads to get there.

          <h2>DNS servers</h2>
          <p>
            The Domain Name System (DNS) makes the modern internet possible. The
            DNS pairs website names you can easily remember with IP addresses
            that computers can use. IPv4 addresses are every bit as valid as a
            website’s alphabetical name. You can type 157.240.22.35 into your
            web browser, and it’ll take you to Facebook. But who’s going to
            remember that? Most of us barely remember our own phone numbers.
            Familiar domain names are substitutes for real IP addresses. In the
            early days of the internet, you could connect to another site only
            by typing in the numbers of its IP address. But thanks to the DNS,
            we don't need to do this anymore. The DNS freed us from the headache
            of remembering IP addresses by giving each site a name. DNS servers
            sit between your browser and the site you want to visit. When you
            type a URL into your browser, your browser looks up that domain name
            in the DNS server, retrieves the corresponding IP address, and sends
            you to the site you want. All without you, the user, needing to do a
            thing.

          <h2>What is a Router?</h2>
          <p>
            Routers are networking devices operating at layer 3 or a network
            layer of the OSI model. They are responsible for receiving,
            analyzing, and forwarding data packets among the connected computer
            networks. When a data packet arrives, the router inspects the
            destination address, consults its routing tables to decide the
            optimal route and then transfers the packet along this route.

          <h3>Features of Routers:</h3>
          <ul id="router_list">
            <li>A router is a layer 3 or network layer device.</li>

            <li>
              It connects different networks together and sends data packets
              from one network to another.
            </li>

            <li>
              A router can be used both in LANs (Local Area Networks) and WANs
              (Wide Area Networks).
            </li>

            <li>
              It transfers data in the form of IP packets. In order to transmit
              data, it uses IP address mentioned in the destination field <br />
              of the IP packet.
            </li>

            <li>
              Routers have a routing table in it that is refreshed periodically
              according to the changes in the network. In order to transmit
              <br />
              data packets, it consults the table and uses a routing protocol.
            </li>

            <li>
              In order to prepare or refresh the routing table, routers share
              information among each other.
            </li>

            <li>Routers provide protection against broadcast storms.</li>

            <li>
              Routers are more expensive than other networking devices like
              hubs,bridges and switches.
            </li>
